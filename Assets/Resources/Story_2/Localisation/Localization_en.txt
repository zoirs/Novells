$room_2_scene_1_frame_1=Beyond the window, the sea glistened impatiently with waves. Anna had to squint her eyes to continue looking at the harbor.
$room_2_scene_1_frame_2= Outside, loading was in full swing, with a line of passengers showing tickets to the liner's staff. Things, like her own, had been brought on board in advance.
$room_2_scene_1_frame_3=A seagull cried out.

$room_2_scene_2_frame_1=Amazing. If it weren't for this view, it wouldn't be any different from a hotel room.
$room_2_scene_2_frame_2=The window won't open...
$room_2_scene_2_frame_3=Of course, genius! I wish airliners had portholes that opened!
$room_2_scene_2_frame_4=The girl tapped her fingernails nervously on the frame and looked around the cabin again. She wanted to pass the time somehow.
$room_2_scene_2_frame_5=Should we unpack?
$room_2_scene_2_frame_6=Her suitcase, borrowed from her aunt, stood modestly by the nearest bed.
$room_2_scene_2_frame_7=The other had a mountain of luggage.

$story.btn.anna.see.things=See.
$story.btn.anna.take.things.apart=Unpack your things

$room_2_scene_3_frame_1=Anna opened her suitcase.
$room_2_scene_3_frame_2=A photo frame lay hastily thrown inside on top. A happy family, two children, an older girl and a little boy, and a mother, looked out from the tree framed picture.
$room_2_scene_3_frame_3=I'm sorry. I shouldn't have run away from my problems.
$room_2_scene_3_frame_4=And that's exactly what I'm doing right now.
$room_2_scene_3_frame_5=Anna turned the photo over, trying to leave the heavy thoughts behind. However, the edge of the frame caught on the fabric and her underwear fell out onto the cabin floor.
$room_2_scene_3_frame_6=Instinctively, she grabbed the items and shoved them back into her pocket. Her cheeks turned pink.
$room_2_scene_3_frame_7=How embarrassing! What if someone had walked in?
$room_2_scene_3_frame_8=I still haven't seen my cabin mate.

$room_2_scene_4_frame_1=Suitcase, basket, bag... Gosh, it's like my traveling companion is moving here for life!
$room_2_scene_4_frame_2=I guess he loves flights - there's a lot of stickers. Some of them look old. Maybe he collects flights?
$room_2_scene_4_frame_3=What's this?
$room_2_scene_4_frame_4=Anna stepped closer, and a strange symbol appeared on the side of the suitcase. Several petals entering one into the other.
$room_2_scene_4_frame_5=How unusual. Must be an interesting conversationalist!

$room_2_scene_5_frame_1=It would be nice to get a cute guy in here. Or someone quiet...
$room_2_scene_5_frame_2=The intrigue didn't last long - the door swung open abruptly.
$room_2_scene_5_frame_3=Cabin 28?
$room_2_scene_5_frame_4=Да…
$room_2_scene_5_frame_5=That's right-- the stuff's here. Let's get acquainted.
$room_2_scene_5_frame_6=The stranger placed a pot of blue flowers on the table and extended her hand for a shake. It seemed too strong for such narrow and dry brush.
$room_2_scene_5_frame_7=Minute - and here was the neighbor already rummaging through the bowels of her suitcase.
$room_2_scene_5_frame_8=Nice to meet you. Are you bringing flowers?
$room_2_scene_5_frame_9=The girl mumbled something without raising her head.
$room_2_scene_5_frame_10=Что?
$room_2_scene_5_frame_11=Aconites, I said. Not just any flowers.
$room_2_scene_5_frame_12=The kind that are... pretty.
$room_2_scene_5_frame_13=Glad you like them. But don't touch them, they're very finicky.
$room_2_scene_5_frame_14=An awkward pause has occurred....

$story.btn.anna.2_5.1=Represent.
$story.btn.anna.2_5.2=Ask about flowers.
$story.btn.anna.2_5.3=Ask for directions
$story.btn.anna.2_5.4=Discuss the weather

$room_2_scene_6_frame_1=Since we're cabin mates, I think it's worth introducing ourselves. Я...
$room_2_scene_6_frame_2=Anna, I know.
$room_2_scene_6_frame_3=You know? How?
$room_2_scene_6_frame_4=The girl waved her ringed hand without distraction:
$room_2_scene_6_frame_5=A list of names hangs on the wall in the hallway.
$room_2_scene_6_frame_6=Oh, really?
$room_2_scene_6_frame_7=I can be so absent-minded sometimes... What's your name?
$room_2_scene_6_frame_8=Call me... Lilit.
$room_2_scene_6_frame_9=The pause did not escape Anna. However, there was nothing to do - not to pester her with questions.
$room_2_scene_6_frame_10=She was strange!

$room_2_scene_7_frame_1=The aconites seem to be poisonous. How can you bring something like that into the cabin?
$room_2_scene_7_frame_2=The girl looked directly into Anna's eyes for the first time. The look in her dark eyes made her want to hide.
$room_2_scene_7_frame_3=If you plan on eating the flowers, maybe.
$room_2_scene_7_frame_4=And they're perfectly safe in pots.

$room_2_scene_8_frame_1=Anna tried to sound nonchalant.
$room_2_scene_8_frame_2=I have a ticket to the end of the cruise. Been wanting to unwind like this for a long time, no phone, no constant calls....
$room_2_scene_8_frame_3=Ha! You work with people?
$room_2_scene_8_frame_4=Yes. Are you a full-time traveler too?
$room_2_scene_8_frame_5=Full. Need to... meet someone.

$room_2_scene_9_frame_1=The forecast promised nice wind and sunshine all week! Great to go sightseeing....
$room_2_scene_9_frame_2=I don't think so. The clouds will gather by evening and it will rain.
$room_2_scene_9_frame_3=Anna was taken aback by this abrupt answer.
$room_2_scene_9_frame_4=Why do you think that? There's a barometer on the wall, the pressure is high.
$room_2_scene_9_frame_5=He's wrong. It's definitely going to rain, I just know it.
$room_2_scene_9_frame_6=Ah, you're weather sensitive, aren't you?
$room_2_scene_9_frame_7=Sort of.

$room_2_scene_10_frame_1=Anna wanted to continue the conversation, but the girl's concentrated face said one thing: now was not the best time. A tense atmosphere hung in the cabin.
$room_2_scene_10_frame_2=I'll go on deck, I won't disturb you.
$room_2_scene_10_frame_3=Uh-huh.
$room_2_scene_10_frame_4=Anna left the room, and her shoulders relaxed involuntarily.
$room_2_scene_10_frame_5=What a lady!

$story.btn.anna.2_10.1=I don't like her!
$story.btn.anna.2_10.2=Maybe we can be friends later?

$room_2_scene_11_frame_1=It took a couple minutes to walk up the stairs. As soon as she stepped onto the deck, the salty wind blew Anna's hair and the cries of seagulls snapped her out of her reverie. The sea was splashing and foaming all the way to the horizon.
$room_2_scene_11_frame_2=What a beauty! I can't believe I'm going on a cruise!
$room_2_scene_11_frame_3=Albeit under such difficult circumstances. And with such a traveling companion.
$room_2_scene_11_frame_4=She turned toward the harbor.
$room_2_scene_11_frame_5=There were people crowded on the shore near the docks. They looked gloomy.
$room_2_scene_11_frame_6=Some of the crew were waving their arms, trying to make way for the movers.
$room_2_scene_11_frame_7=What is it?
$room_2_scene_11_frame_8=The dolphin. Dead.
$room_2_scene_11_frame_9=Bad luck. One of the passengers is in trouble.
$room_2_scene_11_frame_10=An unfriendly neighbor appeared so suddenly that Anna flinched. She was completely absorbed in the scene at the docks, however, and looked on with such concern as if the dolphin's demise had touched her personally.
$room_2_scene_11_frame_11=Are you sure?
$room_2_scene_11_frame_12=I've read about it. By the way, let's go with “you” just Lilit.

$room_2_scene_12_frame_1=Not wanting to be around her strange neighbor, Anna spent a couple of hours on deck with other passengers. The waves, the seagulls and the views of the harbor behind her stirred her soul and begged to be photographed.
$room_2_scene_12_frame_2=The girl had time to walk all over the ship. It seemed bigger inside than outside, and the architects used every meter wisely.
$room_2_scene_12_frame_3=After satisfying her curiosity, Anna gathered herself back to her room.

$room_2_scene_13_frame_1=Don't you wonder what's outside?
$room_2_scene_13_frame_2=Lilit turned the page of the book she was holding. The stone of the ring sparkled under the lamp.
$room_2_scene_13_frame_3=Not particularly. The sea is always the same.
$room_2_scene_13_frame_4=Lilit's look was not good, and Anna ahhed.
$room_2_scene_13_frame_5=My God, are you... are you okay? Look at you - completely pale!
$room_2_scene_13_frame_6=Lilit twitched an eyebrow, but sighed heavily after a couple seconds.
$room_2_scene_13_frame_7=I get seasick. I know the rocking is minimized by all sorts of mechanisms here, but I'm sensitive to ground shaking.
$room_2_scene_13_frame_8=There's no shame in it! You can take some medicine or distraction, it'll make it easier.

$story.btn.anna.2_13.1=Ask for a first aid kit.
$story.btn.anna.2_13.2=Try to sleep.
$story.btn.anna.2_13.3=Go out on deck, the fresh air is invigorating.
$story.btn.anna.2_13.4=Take your mind off things.

$room_2_scene_14_frame_1=Pills? No, I'm not poisoning myself with chemicals.
$room_2_scene_14_frame_2=There's a better way.
$room_2_scene_14_frame_3=She showed me a cloth baggie that she held under her nose.
$room_2_scene_14_frame_4=Ginger, lemon, cardamom. My grandmother taught me.
$room_2_scene_14_frame_5=You don't look like you're doing much good.
$room_2_scene_14_frame_6=Lilit snorted, but without anger - she didn't have the strength.

$room_2_scene_15_frame_1=The neighbor shook her head tiredly.
$room_2_scene_15_frame_2=It doesn't help. Even in my sleep, I feel like there's no reliable support.

$room_2_scene_16_frame_1=
$room_2_scene_16_frame_2=

$room_2_scene_17_frame_1=Lilit pointed to the book.
$room_2_scene_17_frame_2=So your letters are jumping in front of your eyes! Is that any way to be distracted?
$room_2_scene_17_frame_3=Let me show you something...
$room_2_scene_17_frame_4=Anna pulled out her smartphone and tried to open a fresh snapshot of the harbor and birds.
$room_2_scene_17_frame_5=The screen flickered convulsively. The girl tried again and again - to no avail.
$room_2_scene_17_frame_6=It had never glitched like this before...
$room_2_scene_17_frame_7=Doesn't any machinery break down near you by any chance?
$room_2_scene_17_frame_8=breaking down.
$room_2_scene_17_frame_9=Pause. Trying to make a joke and smooth over the awkwardness only exacerbated it.

$room_2_scene_18_frame_1=Thank you for trying to help. Usually nothing helps me.
$room_2_scene_18_frame_2=Oh, I remember! The brochure says you can ask for board games in the room. Would that distract you?
$room_2_scene_18_frame_3=Okay, roomie. Let's give it a try.
$room_2_scene_18_frame_4=Although there was a casino on board, the workers had a deck of cards. 
$room_2_scene_18_frame_5=An hour later, Anna was already regretting offering such entertainment. She had lost every game they had played.
$room_2_scene_18_frame_6=At least Lilit's face looked better and the symptoms of seasickness receded.
$room_2_scene_18_frame_7=And once again you get to fulfill my wish! Let me see...
$room_2_scene_18_frame_8=Anna gave a pretend groan.

$room_2_scene_19_frame_1=How do you do that? What are you, a witch?
$room_2_scene_19_frame_2=The words came out faster than Anna could think them through.
$room_2_scene_19_frame_3=Lilit laughed. Something subtly changed in her gaze, however.
$room_2_scene_19_frame_4=Anything lucky enough to be a witch?

$room_2_scene_20_frame_1=I made a wish! Walk on the liner with my pet in your arms!
$room_2_scene_20_frame_2=Anna picked up a pot of aconites. It turned out to be surprisingly bulky.
$room_2_scene_20_frame_3=I'm definitely not playing after this!
$room_2_scene_20_frame_4=Come on, come on, come on!
$room_2_scene_20_frame_5=Lilit opened the door in front of her, and Anna stepped over the threshold.
$room_2_scene_20_frame_6= Her foot immediately went sideways. The girl swayed, trying to keep her balance on the wet floor, but failed and flew to the floor.
$room_2_scene_20_frame_7=Ouch!
$room_2_scene_20_frame_8=The hand was sore. The pot was somehow miraculously still intact.
$room_2_scene_20_frame_9=Feet stomping was heard in the hallway. Anna had time to see two boys fleeing in the back.
$room_2_scene_20_frame_10=Lilit immediately realized everything.
$room_2_scene_20_frame_11=With evil you have come, you will be repaid twice!
$room_2_scene_20_frame_12=At that moment, the unexpected happened. The boys, as if some force had pushed them, lost their running speed and fell to the floor, making a pile-up. 
$room_2_scene_20_frame_13=Lilit's eyes flashed red and immediately went out.
$room_2_scene_20_frame_14=She lifted Anna to her feet with a single jerk and intercepted the ill-fated flower. The girls were back in the room, the door slammed.

$room_2_scene_21_frame_1=What a coincidence! Instant karma, huh?
$room_2_scene_21_frame_2=In the morning Anna saw no trace of her traveling companion in the cabin-not her, not her luggage, not the strange potted flower.
$room_2_scene_21_frame_3=Dream. Just a dream.

$room_2_scene_22_frame_1=Anna looked at Lilith with wide-open eyes.
$room_2_scene_22_frame_2=Good guess, right?
$room_2_scene_22_frame_3=If you can so...

$story.btn.anna.2_22.1=Should I be afraid of you?
$story.btn.anna.2_22.2=Can you teach me...please?
$story.btn.anna.2_22.3=If you are a witch...can you help me?

$room_2_scene_23_frame_1=You've been good to me. I won't harm you.
$room_2_scene_23_frame_2=If you don't start talking.

$room_2_scene_24_frame_1=We'll see.
$room_2_scene_24_frame_2=We need to check your potential first.

$room_2_scene_25_frame_1=You're my last chance!
$room_2_scene_25_frame_2=This is why I don't like liners. More beggars!
$room_2_scene_25_frame_3=Lilit's eyes turned red again. Anna covered her face with the palm of her hand, but didn't have time to do anything.
$room_2_scene_25_frame_4=The world faded in and out.
